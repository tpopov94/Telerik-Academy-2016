/*We are given a school. In the school there are classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. 
 * Each teacher teaches, a set of disciplines. Students have a name and unique class number. 
 * Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have a name. Disciplines have a name, number of lectures and number of exercises. 
 * Both teachers and students are people. Students, classes, teachers and disciplines could have optional comments (free text block).
 * Your task is to identify the classes (in terms of OOP) and their attributes and operations, encapsulate their fields, 
 * define the class hierarchy and create a class diagram with Visual Studio.*/
