# Unit Testing
## Building Rock-Solid Software

A **unit test** is a piece of code written by a developer that exercises a very small, specific area of functionality of the code being tested.

**"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!"**

Edsger Dijkstra, [1972]
